The Unit test file should be in the same directory of the module i am testing
The file name should be <>_test.go

import "testing": th estandar golang module for testing

Create a function func Test<Functionname>(t *testing.T): the function should start with Test and then the name of the function

Go to project folder and run go test ./...: it will run all the unit tests of the project
                                            -v: it will print the error messages


To have more control in the test of the package implement 
    func TestMain(m *testing.M) that has a m.Run() method that runs all the tests
    Can execute some code before of after the m.Run()
